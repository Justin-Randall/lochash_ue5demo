# Location Hash Illustrative Demonstration

This is a hastily put together illustration of the location hash [https://github.com/Justin-Randall/lochash](https://github.com/Justin-Randall/lochash) in action. The purpose is to merely help visualize what it is doing at runtime. It is NOT intended to be any serious tool for physics on game clients. The algorithm is niche, but generalized enough around use cases that map coordinates with data/objects.

The algorithm itself is mostly a hobby project and exercise. Again, also illustrative to demonstrate what it does and potential use-cases, not production code.
